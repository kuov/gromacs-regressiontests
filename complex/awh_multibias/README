AWH multiple biases and continuation

Tests biasing of two one-dimensional dihedral angle coordinates (phi and psi)
for alanine dipeptide in vacuum. This also test the periodic AWH grid.
Furthermore, it checks checkpoint writing and continuation, which are
the major components of the AWH module that are not covered by module tests.

If the continue.cpt checkpoint file requires an update, e.g. because the
checkpoint file format changes, run the reference_s.tpr file for 20 steps,
and then preserve the resulting checkpoint file as continue.cpt.
