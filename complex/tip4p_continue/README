Continue from checkpoint
    
This test checks that a simulation with tip4p water can be continued
from a checkpoint file. The checkpoint file is in single precision
and is also used for the double precision test.

The checkpoint file is generated with v2022-dev by running 5 steps
from the reference_s.tpr file. It will need to be updated when the
checkpoint file format changes, as we do not keep the format stable
between major versions of GROMACS.
