WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  For isotropic scaling we would recommend the C-rescale barostat that also
  ensures fast relaxation without oscillations, and for anisotropic scaling
  you likely want to use the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.
